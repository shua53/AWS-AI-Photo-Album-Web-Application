# AWS AI Photo Album Web Application
- Designed and implemented a cloud-based photo album application enabling natural language search capabilities through both text and voice inputs, leveraging AWS services including Lex, OpenSearch, and Rekognition.
- Engineered a scalable architecture by launching an OpenSearch instance within a secure VPC environment, ensuring data privacy and system integrity.
Automated photo indexing by developing AWS Lambda functions triggered by S3 bucket uploads, incorporating image recognition to classify and tag photos with relevant metadata.
- Enhanced user search experience by creating a custom Amazon Lex bot, capable of understanding and processing natural language queries for dynamic photo retrieval.
- Constructed a RESTful API using AWS API Gateway, facilitating seamless integration between the frontend application and backend services.
- Spearheaded the frontend development to provide an intuitive user interface for photo uploads and searches, incorporating voice search functionality through Amazon Transcribe for accessibility.
- Implemented continuous integration and delivery pipelines using AWS CodePipeline, achieving automated builds and deployments for rapid iteration and robust application performance.
- Encapsulated the entire infrastructure and deployment workflow within an AWS CloudFormation template, allowing for reproducible and scalable application deployment.
